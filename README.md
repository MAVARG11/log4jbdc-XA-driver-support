# log4jbdc-XA-driver-support
log4jdbc implementation with XA driver support

This project is modified version of original log4jdbc project(a maven implementation, originally forked by someone. i added oracle XA driver support. you have to use the right oracle driver in the classpath to work). it's very simple effective JDBC spy driver implementation, especially useful when you work with ORMs/JPA implementations. enjoy!!!
